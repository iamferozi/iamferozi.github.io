						<h3 id = "Heading1" > About </h3>
						<p id = "normal" > A computer science graduate from Sindh Madrasah-Tul-Islam University. Technology enthusiast. Coding since 2016. My thirst for knowledge is never quenched. As a Unity Engineer, I am working for a multi-national mobile game development organization for the past 2 years. I am a multi-domain expert with different levels of expertise in different fields. My core domain is .Net and game development and I have profound experience in Unity, Unreal, Photoshop, Blender, and Audacity.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">Why I Wanted To Learn Unity</h3>
						<p id = "normal">I have spent my whole childhood playing games and I always get fascinated by simulation game and their logic and mechanism. What disappoints me most is that my imagination can't be a part of this genre. To accomplish my dreams, I learned game development with Unity at my University and manage to get a job that pays for my passion. My weekdays gave me experience and my weekend became my dev-journey for my imaginary game.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">How I Approached Learning Unity</h3>
						<p id = "normal"> I started with YouTube, where I learned Unity, which helped me to grasp my basics. Then I worked on some minor projects of my own, which helped me get a real-life coding experience. Downloaded GitHub projects to learn how intermediate and experts code. Created my own GitHub to upload my noob projects. Read through Unity forums which helped me fix errors. Overall, I never spent a single penny on courses or tutorials. Unity community is spread out all over the internet and you'll never need to pay for learning the basics of Unity.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">Challenges I Faced</h3>
						<p id = "normal">Folder structure, version control, coding convention are some of the few techniques which if I had learned parallel with Unity, might have helped me maintain my projects.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">Key Takeaways</h3>
						<p id = "normal">Always remember, Coding in Unity does not complete your journey. Exploring other game engines, libraries and projects will help to complete your profile.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">Tips and Advice</h3>
						<p id = "normal">Brakeys, Sabastian Lague and GMTK are the best initiatives for newbies to explore the basics. Its organized and point-to-point tutorials help learners to gather required information in a limited time.</p>
						<h3 id = "Heading1">Final Thoughts And Next Steps</h3>
						<p id = "normal">Unity is a great engine, quite popular for indie developers, but you can't be a game developer until you explore. Development is always a key role, but the game development domain requires designing and modeling too, so make sure you learn the basics.</p>
